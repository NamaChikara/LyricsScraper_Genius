<h1>Lamp Lit Prose by Dirty Projectors</h1><h2>Right Now</h2><div class="lyrics">
<!--sse-->
<p>[Verse 1: David Longstreth]<br/>
The sky has darkened, earth turned to hell<br/>
Some said a light got shined where darkness dwelt<br/>
So I won't cry or collapse, overwhelmed<br/>
Time like a song just might rhyme with itself<br/>
<br/>
[Pre-Chorus 1: David Longstreth]<br/>
I don't know how I'm going to be a better man<br/>
I don't know how I'm going to reach the Promised Land<br/>
I don't know how I'm going to get you to take my hand<br/>
But I'm going to try and I know when<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus: David Longstreth + <i>Syd</i>]<br/>
Now <i>(now)</i><br/>
Right now <i>(now)</i><br/>
Right now <i>(now)</i><br/>
Right now <i>(now)</i><br/>
Right now, now <i>(now)</i><br/>
Right now, now <i>(now)</i><br/>
Right now, now <i>(now)</i><br/>
Right now<br/>
<br/>
[Verse 2: David Longstreth]<br/>
Soon the earth may dissolve like snow<br/>
We'll meet again in the air all bound to glow<br/>
And I am glad that I got to know<br/>
I might sing the melody<br/>
But I don't set the tempo<br/>
<br/>
[Pre-Chorus 2: David Longstreth]<br/>
Who draws the true straw from the fist that's clasped?<br/>
Who pulls the new rope through the loopholes of the past?<br/>
Better hurry up for the first shall be the last<br/>
Better sound the trumpet before the blast<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus: David Longstreth + <i>Syd</i>]<br/>
Now <i>(now)</i><br/>
Right <i>(now)</i><br/>
Now, right <i>(now)</i><br/>
Now, right now <i>(now)</i><br/>
Right now <i>(now)</i><br/>
Now, right now <i>(now)</i><br/>
Now, right now <i>(now)</i><br/>
Now, right now<br/>
<br/>
[Instrumental Bridge]<br/>
<br/>
[Pre-Chorus 3]<br/>
You pulled me up when you took my hand<br/>
There was silence in my heart<br/>
And now I'm striking up the band<br/>
They lit the bonfire but now we can light the lamp<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus: David Longstreth + <i>Syd</i>]<br/>
Now <i>(now)</i><br/>
Right now <i>(now)</i><br/>
Right now <i>(now)</i><br/>
Right now <i>(now)</i><br/>
Right now, now <i>(now)</i><br/>
Right now <i>(now, now)</i><br/>

Right now <i>(now, now)</i><br/>
Right now <i>(now, now)</i><br/>

<!--sse-->
<p>[Verse 1]<br/>
What's up?<br/>
How's it going?<br/>
Neo real cheekbone<br/>
She is so dreamy<br/>
Like she's got features on Fellini<br/>
Deadpan, unimpressed<br/>
Archimedes Palimpsest<br/>
Just hanging out all Julian Casablancas<br/>
<br/>
[Pre-Chorus]<br/>
She is an epiphany<br/>
Her electricity opens my days like she always knew<br/>
I feel an affinity, immediately<br/>
In all the ways, she's a break-thru<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
Under the sun, there's nothing new<br/>
But she keeps it 100 in the shade<br/>
She's a break-thru<br/>
It's cold out there<br/>
That's nothing new<br/>
But she keeps it 100 through the shade<br/>
She's a break-thru<br/>
<br/>
[Verse 2]<br/>
She is so wow<br/>
Middle-earth highbrow<br/>
Her line is Pablo but her color's Fauve<br/>
So what about it?<br/>
Just to review<br/>
She will a-break thru<br/>
Nobody stops her<br/>
No one can lock her down<br/>
<br/>
[Pre-Chorus]<br/>
She is an epiphany<br/>
Her electricity opens my days like she always knew<br/>
I feel an affinity, immediately<br/>
In all her ways, she's a break-thru<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
Under the sun, there's nothing new<br/>
But she keeps it 100 in the shade<br/>
She's a break-thru<br/>
It's cold out there<br/>
That's nothing new<br/>
But she keeps it 100 through the shade<br/>
She's a break-thru<br/>
<br/>
[Bridge]<br/>
She's a break-thru<br/>
She's a break-thru<br/>
She's a break-thru<br/>
She's a break-thru<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
Under the sun, there's nothing new<br/>
But she keeps it 100 in the shade<br/>
She's a break-thru<br/>
It's hot out here<br/>
And warming too<br/>
But she keeps it 100 through the shade<br/>
She's a break-thru<br/>
<br/>
[Outro]<br/>
She's a break-thru<br/>
She's a break-thru<br/>
She's a break-thru<br/>
She's a break-thru</p>

</div><h2>Thats A Lifestyle</h2><div class="lyrics">
<!--sse-->
<p>[Verse 1]<br/>
Who will stop wasting the lives of the brave<br/>
Based on a lie?<br/>
Who will stop wasting the forest and seas?<br/>
We know what will survive<br/>
Who will stop wasting the time?<br/>
Who will stop putting quarters upon on our eyes?<br/>
Who will not place himself higher than we<br/>
For a senator's prize?<br/>
<br/>
[Pre-Chorus 1]<br/>
We wander out wild-eyed<br/>
Kinda drunk and kinda high<br/>
We know what for and why<br/>
That's a product, that's a brand, that's a lifestyle<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
'Cause the monster eats its young<br/>
Till they're gone, gone, gone<br/>
And the rules are there to hurt<br/>
And that's the way it's done<br/>
Yeah, the monster eats its young<br/>
Till they're gone, gone, gone<br/>
Till it's satisfied and done<br/>
It wants blood, blood, blood<br/>
<br/>
[Verse 2]<br/>
Who could look up from the numbers and say<br/>
"Something ain't right"?<br/>
Who could disrupt the abundance and pray<br/>
Not for weight but for light?<br/>
How could we risk the empire<br/>
As the apprentice descends into seasons of Idol<br/>
When our old, white Lincoln encrypted and high<br/>
Sputters down from the sky<br/>
Red-eyed in July, weeping glycol?<br/>
<br/>
[Pre-Chorus 2]<br/>
We shout out loud, megaphone<br/>
Kinda zoned but listening in<br/>
We browse our own episodes<br/>
That's a product, that's a brand, that's a lifestyle<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
'Cause the monster eats its young<br/>
Till they're gone, gone, gone<br/>
And the rules are there to hurt<br/>
And that's the way it's done<br/>
And the monster eats its young<br/>
Till they're gone, gone, gone<br/>
Till it's satisfied and done<br/>
It wants blood, blood, blood<br/>
<br/>
That's a product, that's a brand, that's a lifestyle<br/>
That's a product, that's a brand, that's a lifestyle<br/>
<br/>
[Instrumental Bridge]<br/>
<br/>
[Verse 3]<br/>
When the predator dips out from the haze<br/>
Who knows the price?<br/>
When the words mercy and justice are raised<br/>
Members only apply<br/>
When will we count all the signs?<br/>
When will we finally not let fear weaponize?<br/>
When will the courage to breathe and let breathe<br/>
Assure the land will survive?<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
'Cause the monster eats its young<br/>
Till they're gone, gone, gone<br/>
And the rules are there to hurt<br/>
And that's the way it's done<br/>
Yeah, the monster eats its young<br/>
Till they're gone, gone, gone<br/>
Till it's satisfied and done<br/>
It wants blood, blood, blood<br/>
<br/>
That's a product, that's a brand, that's a lifestyle<br/>
That's a product, that's a brand, that's a lifestyle</p>

</div><h2>I Feel Energy</h2><div class="lyrics">
<!--sse-->
<p>[Verse 1: David Longstreth]<br/>
Garden of flowers all bloom<br/>
When they're watered right<br/>
Laughter echoes in the room but it dies outside<br/>
Are we fundamentally alone in the universe?<br/>
What would it possibly mean if we found in each other<br/>
<br/>
[Pre-Chorus 1: David Longstreth]<br/>
Something unexplained (and the feel remains lingering)<br/>
Strange lights (in the summer night sky)<br/>
Something opening (an auspicious beginning)<br/>
From the time when my eyes saw the design<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus: David Longstreth + Amber Mark]<br/>
I feel energy<br/>
Could this be just a tender dream?<br/>
I feel energy, yeah<br/>
I breathe, you breathe, we<br/>
I, I, I, I feel energy<br/>
I feel energy<br/>
<br/>
[Post-Chorus: David Longstreth]<br/>
Sometimes I get so depressed (depressed)<br/>
And I just can't move<br/>
Don't cry, they make you feel like you're dead (dead)<br/>
And it's never going to improve<br/>
<br/>
[Pre-Chorus 2: David Longstreth]<br/>
But then something unexplained (and the feel remains lingering)<br/>
Perfume (in the midsummer night)<br/>
Something opening (a new consciousness beginning)<br/>
In the room when my eyes saw the design<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus: David Longstreth + Amber Mark]<br/>
I feel energy<br/>
Could this be just a tender dream?<br/>
I feel energy<br/>
I feel energy, yeah<br/>
I feel energy<br/>
I dream, you dream, we<br/>
I, I, I, I feel energy<br/>
I feel energy<br/>
I, I, I, I feel energy<br/>
I feel energy<br/>
<br/>
[Bridge: David Longstreth]<br/>
What entitles you to live again?<br/>
The world's about to end<br/>
How can you pretend?<br/>
Strife and survival<br/>
We wholly depend<br/>
On our hope and love received and sent<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus: Amber Mark + David Longstreth]<br/>
I, I, I, I feel energy<br/>
I feel energy<br/>
I, I, I, I feel energy<br/>
I feel energy<br/>
I feel energy (I feel)<br/>
I, I, I, I feel energy<br/>
I feel, I feel<br/>
I feel energy<br/>
I feel energy<br/>
I, I, I, I feel energy<br/>
I feel energy<br/>
I feel energy<br/>
I feel energy (I feel)<br/>
<br/>
[Outro: Amber Mark + David Longstreth]<br/>
I feel energy<br/>
I feel energy<br/>
I feel energy<br/>
I, I, I, I feel energy<br/>
I feel energy<br/>
I feel energy<br/>
I, I, I, I feel energy</p>

</div><h2>Zombie Conquerer</h2><div class="lyrics">
<!--sse-->
<p>[Verse 1: David Longstreth]<br/>
Crazy to feel like this<br/>
Up and down, simultaneous<br/>
Victory and defeat<br/>
One to one, we'll have to wait and see<br/>
<br/>
And now the clouds are gathered<br/>
My eyes are bright, my khakis tattered<br/>
<br/>
[Pre-Chorus 1: David Longstreth]<br/>
The stakes are raised<br/>
The townspeople are anxious and alert<br/>
The surface of the reservoir is mirrored and inert<br/>
The flag is hanging motionless on the pole outside the court<br/>
And in their homes the people look with stares they can't avert<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus: David Longstreth]<br/>
Zombie conqueror<br/>
We see into the midnight in front of us<br/>
Zombie conqueror<br/>
We see into the midnight in front of us<br/>
My friend, we'll have to free each other more than once<br/>
Zombie conqueror<br/>
We see into the midnight in front of us<br/>
Night, night<br/>
<br/>
[Verse 2: David Longstreth]<br/>
I left home at fifteen<br/>
I knew no home between<br/>
Half a life goes by<br/>
Only a picture of the sky<br/>
<br/>
And now the clouds are gathered<br/>
My eyes are bright, my khakis tattered<br/>
<br/>
[Pre-Chorus 2: David Longstreth]<br/>
The blocking characters all plotting new disloyalty<br/>
But sensing their irrelevance, they're frowning and displeased<br/>
The car chased through the mini-mall amaryllis on the hood<br/>
The race to clear the courthouse has been won and all is good<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus: David Longstreth + <i>Empress Of</i>]<br/>
<i>(Zombie conqueror)</i><br/>
<i>(Zombie conqueror)</i><br/>
Zombie conqueror <i>(zombie conqueror)</i><br/>
We see into the midnight in front of us<br/>
Zombie conqueror <i>(zombie conqueror)</i><br/>
We see into the midnight in front of us<br/>
My friend, we'll have to free each other more than once<br/>
Zombie conqueror <i>(zombie conqueror)</i><br/>
We see into the midnight in front of us<br/>
Night, night</p>

<p>[Verse 1]<br/>
Sky is blue, the sun shines everywhere<br/>
Breeze is blowing, messing up your hair<br/>
The Palace Versailles is nice<br/>
But if I am honest<br/>
I feel just fine on this bench with<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
You and me<br/>
Me and you<br/>
Something sweet<br/>
Something new<br/>
Fresh and clean<br/>
Like the beginning<br/>
Blue bird, sing your tune<br/>
From the lilacs in bloom<br/>
<br/>
[Verse 2]<br/>
Walk around the city in the light<br/>
Talk about whatever's in our minds<br/>
I admit some surprise and delight<br/>
Fascinated by you<br/>
I feel lucky to get time with<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
You and me<br/>
Me and you<br/>
Something sweet<br/>
Something new<br/>
Fresh and clean<br/>
Like the beginning<br/>
Blue bird, sing your tune<br/>
From the lilacs in bloom<br/>

</div><h2>I Found It In U</h2><div class="lyrics">
<!--sse-->
<p>[Verse 1]<br/>
Ask now, I'm in love for the first time ever<br/>
The universe becomes my mom and my dad<br/>
A hand in a glove on a joint adventure<br/>
Moving toward our own Goldilocks planet<br/>
'Cause when everyone latched like autotune<br/>
Into the grid that they all just assumed<br/>
Was and was not a map of the universe<br/>
They just misplaced the pure wave that is you<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
I found it in you<br/>
I found it in you<br/>
I found it in you<br/>
I found it in you<br/>
<br/>
[Verse 2]<br/>
Everybody wants the same chimera<br/>
Everyone hungry but honey get off the feeds<br/>
Salt of the sea and the salt of Sierras<br/>
I preach to birds and then bees preach back to me<br/>
Now in hindsight the alienation<br/>
And all the painful dreams I failed to extinguish<br/>
Were the foot lights down dark aisles I've taken<br/>
Now they've led me to you and I'm singing<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
I found it in you<br/>
I found it in you<br/>
I found it in you<br/>
I found it in you<br/>
I found<br/>
<br/>
[Verse 3]<br/>
And when we met there were alien hosannas<br/>
Thrown from the heavens like Prince and Nirvana<br/>
Like braided brooks tied tides woven oceans<br/>
Like the trees interleaved with explosions<br/>
Of birdsong as they're singing to me<br/>
Down to earth in the land of the free<br/>
In the new time that you've given to me<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
I found it in you<br/>
I found it in you<br/>
I found it in you<br/>
I found it in you<br/>
I found it in you<br/>
I found<br/>
I found<br/>
I found<br/>
I found<br/>
I found<br/>
I found<br/>
I found<br/>

[Outro]<br/>
I (I) have (have) such a (such a) rad (rad) time with you<br/>
Any (any) thing we (thing we) do it's whatever<br/>
That's why I love you</p>

</div><h2>What Is The Time</h2><div class="lyrics">
<!--sse-->
<p>[Verse 1]<br/>
Leave the spoon-fed champions<br/>
Leave the lamp lit prose<br/>
Leave the endlessly distracting matinées<br/>
And say hello<br/>
Hello<br/>
Hello<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
What is the time when I can call you by your name?<br/>
I don't know why it's been so long<br/>
Alone, imagining nobody<br/>
Once in a while, well<br/>
I guess the planets align<br/>
And show me the one I am<br/>
I am the one who would love you<br/>
<br/>
[Verse 2]<br/>
Seek the dusty longshot<br/>
On the last frontier<br/>
Join the minor miracle that looks flat<br/>
But reveals itself a sphere<br/>
As the wheel of inception steers<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
What is the time when I can call you by your name?<br/>
I don't know why it's been so long<br/>
Alone, imagining nobody<br/>
Once in a while, well<br/>
I guess the planets align<br/>
And show me the one I am<br/>
I am the one who would love you<br/>
<br/>
[Bridge]<br/>
They say it's ashes to ashes<br/>
Passion is passing<br/>
And we all will die alone (Wow)<br/>
But while we're here on the planet<br/>
Dancing on granite<br/>
Why don't we drink Côtes du Rhône (Wow)?<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
What is the time when I can call you by your name?<br/>
I don't know why it's been so long<br/>
Alone, imagining nobody<br/>
Once in a while, well<br/>
I guess the planets align<br/>
And show me the one I am<br/>
I am the one who would love you<br/>

What is the time when I can call you by your name?<br/>

One, two, three<br/>

Change is the only constant law<br/>
I've seen some springs and I've seen some falls<br/>
Through all the seasons I have known<br/>
In all my life, I remember the people<br/>

A wheel is in motion and spins til it's spun<br/>
'Til the earth absorbs us, laughing in flowers of sun<br/>

Oh, high thanks I owe you, excellent<br/>
Lover and beautiful friends<br/>
Through all the memories I have been<br/>
Hoping for you to come make my world new again<br/>

[Chorus 2]<br/>
I'll always have love for what came before<br/>

I wanna feel everything<br/>
Sweetness of youth and old age's sting<br/>
Open my eyes wide and unblinking<br/>
I wanna feel everything<br/>

I wanna feel it all<br/>
