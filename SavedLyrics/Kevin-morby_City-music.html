<h1>City Music by Kevin Morby</h1><h2>Come To Me Now</h2><div class="lyrics">
<!--sse-->
<p>[Verse 1]<br/>
Come to me now<br/>
Like you did then<br/>
Pretty and slow<br/>
Pretty and thin<br/>
Ain't got no friend<br/>
In a world so big<br/>
Ain't got no family<br/>
Ain't got no kin<br/>
Where do you go<br/>
Boy, when you die?<br/>
Is it pretty and slow?<br/>
Is it up real high? I don't want to know<br/>
<br/>
[Pre-Chorus]<br/>
I can't wait for the sun to go down<br/>
Tired of squinting at this god-awful town<br/>
I can't wait for that moon to rise<br/>
She's my friend, always been, you can see it in my eyes<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
That I love her<br/>
Yeah, I do<br/>
Oh, I love her<br/>
And she loves me too<br/>
<br/>
[Verse 2]<br/>
Come to me now<br/>
Like you did then<br/>
Pretty and slow<br/>
Pretty and thin<br/>
Where do you go<br/>
When you go out at night?<br/>
When will you come home?<br/>
What did you find?<br/>
Ain't got a friend<br/>
In a world like this<br/>
There is a fortress<br/>
Around my heart<br/>
Till death do we part<br/>
<br/>
[Pre-Chorus]<br/>
I can't wait for the sun to go down<br/>
Tired of squinting at this ugly little town<br/>
I can't wait for that moon to shine<br/>
She's my friend, always been, you can see it in my eyes<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
That I love her<br/>
Yeah, I do<br/>
Oh, I love her<br/>
And she loves me too<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
Oh, I love her<br/>
Yeah, I do<br/>
Yeah, I love her<br/>
And she loves me too<br/>
<br/>
[Bridge]<br/>
You'll burn in her sunlight<br/>
You'll freeze in her night<br/>
You will run that way forever<br/>
Like an echo<br/>
Come on, Mabel<br/>
<br/>
[Outro]<br/>
Come to me now</p>

</div><h2>Crybaby</h2><div class="lyrics">
<!--sse-->
<p>I never was someone that I liked<br/>
I never was someone that you know<br/>
Now the tears flow through my eyes<br/>
And the trouble fell like a snow<br/>
I never walked down an empty street<br/>
I never was someone you'd want to meet<br/>
Just to be a normal man<br/>
Just to go out shaking hands<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm walking hand in hand<br/>
With my self and with my sin<br/>
All alone on a crowded street<br/>
I never was someone you'd want to meet<br/>
Just to be a normal man<br/>
Just to go out making plans<br/>
All alone on a crowded street<br/>
I never was someone you'd want to meet<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I never was someone that I liked<br/>
I never was someone that you know<br/>
Now the tears pull through my eyes<br/>
And the trouble fell like a snow<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And you cried, crybaby<br/>
Come on cry, crybaby<br/>
And you cried, crybaby<br/>
Come on cry, crybaby<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I never walked down an empty street<br/>
I never was someone you'd want to meet<br/>
Just to be a normal man<br/>
Just to go out shaking hands<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And to cry, crybaby<br/>
Come on cry, crybaby<br/>
And to cry, crybaby<br/>
Come on cry, crybaby<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And you cried, cry baby<br/>
Come on cry, cry baby<br/>
And you cried, cry baby</p>

<p>Everybody talking 'bout 1 2 3 4<br/>
Everybody talking 'bout 1 2 3 4<br/>
Everybody do the 1 2 3 4<br/>
Everybody talking 'bout 1 2 3 4<br/>
<br/>
Well you know I'd walk a mile just to die<br/>
Gotta learn what that door is for<br/>
Gotta learn what that door is for<br/>
Gotta learn what that door is for<br/>
Gotta learn what that door is for<br/>
Well you know I'd walk a mile just to die, die, die, die, die<br/>
<br/>
Bad luck coming up<br/>
Good luck is gone<br/>
Bad luck coming up<br/>
Good luck is gone<br/>
<br/>
And the mile that I speak of is the one I'm on<br/>
<br/>
Woo<br/>

They were all my friends<br/>
And they died</p>

</div><h2>Aboard My Train</h2><div class="lyrics">
<!--sse-->
<p>I once loved a boy so smart and true<br/>
We would walk home every day from the school<br/>
He'd say, "I think we could walk forever<br/>
Oh no, how 'bout just a little while?" Okay<br/>
He would make me laugh like the devil, haha<br/>
He would pick me up like the child that I was<br/>
<br/>
In my time I'd like to stay young forever<br/>
Like a tide, the crest beneath sunny weather<br/>
May we fill these lungs with laughter (haha)<br/>
And we may shake these bones with style (watch me now)<br/>
And may we claim all that we're after (everything)<br/>
And may we do it wearing a smile<br/>
And may the breath we breathe be free<br/>
And for you to remain a part of me<br/>
Three, four<br/>
<br/>
[Interlude]<br/>
<br/>
I have loved many faces, many places<br/>
All aboard my train but depart at different stations<br/>
And some of them look the same<br/>
But none of them smell the same<br/>
And some of them will never change<br/>
While some of them are growing strange<br/>
And some of them are center stage<br/>
While some of them go and turn my page<br/>
And some are [?]<br/>
And some are diseased with rage<br/>
Oh, but all of them are aboard my train<br/>
But all of them are a friend of mine<br/>
And oh, my darling, can't you see?<br/>
Oh that, babe, oh, and you, are a part of me</p>

</div><h2>Dry Your Eyes</h2><div class="lyrics">
<!--sse-->
<p>Dry your eyes<br/>
Dry your eyes<br/>
Dry your eyes<br/>
Dry your eyes<br/>
Oh Dry your eyes<br/>
Dry your eyes<br/>
<br/>
Dry your eyes<br/>
Dry your eyes<br/>
Dry your eyes<br/>
Dry your eyes<br/>
Oh Dry your eyes<br/>
Dry your eyes<br/>
<br/>
Go to, down town at dawn<br/>
Just to see what, going on there<br/>
But there ain't no, one I know, no<br/>
No crowd, to be a part of<br/>
<br/>
Now there's tears in my eyes<br/>
Tears in my eyes<br/>
Oh tears in my eyes<br/>
Tears in my eyes<br/>
Tears in my eyes<br/>
Tears in my eyes<br/>
Oh oh Tears in my eyes<br/>
Tears in my eyes<br/>
<br/>
I go to, a city square<br/>
Just to see what, or who I'm gonna find there<br/>
But there ain't no, soul I know<br/>
No commotion, for me to be a part of<br/>
<br/>
Dry your eyes<br/>
Dry your eyes<br/>
Dry your eyes<br/>
Dry your eyes<br/>
Oh dry your eyes<br/>
Dry your eyes<br/>
<br/>
Dry your eyes<br/>
Dry your eyes<br/>
Dry your eyes<br/>
Dry your eyes<br/>
Oh Dry your eyes<br/>

</div><h2>Tin Can</h2><div class="lyrics">
<!--sse-->
<p>I live high<br/>
Oh my tin can up in the sky<br/>
All those people down below<br/>
Oh that city that I long to know<br/>
Moving fast, what's their name?<br/>
Where they going and from which hole they came?<br/>
I'm no one but a face just a stranger in a stranger place<br/>
Breathing out, breathing in<br/>
Sun came up then it went down again<br/>
As I say I am a visitor here<br/>
<br/>
I don't mind<br/>
Oh my tin can up in the sky<br/>
All those people down below<br/>
Oh they're just people that I long to show<br/>
That I'm fast, that I'm game<br/>
So much bigger than the hole I came<br/>
I'm not no one not empty space<br/>
Just a stranger in a strange strange place<br/>
Breathing in, breathing out<br/>
Sun came up and then the sun came down<br/>
And I sing I am a prisoner here<br/>
<br/>
But I don't mind<br/>
<br/>
I live high<br/>
Oh my tin can up in the sky<br/>
All those people down below<br/>
Oh that city that I long to know<br/>
Moving fast, what's their names?<br/>
Where they going and from which hole they came?<br/>
I'm no one but a face just a stranger in a stranger place<br/>
Breathing out, breathing in<br/>
Sun came up then went down again<br/>
As I say I am a visitor here<br/>
<br/>
But I don't mind</p>

</div><h2>Caught In My Eye</h2><div class="lyrics">
<!--sse-->
<p>Though your dark eyes<br/>
You can feel my<br/>
Every sin<br/>
When I walk right<br/>
Into a straight line<br/>
This world of yours<br/>
I got you caught in my eye, again<br/>
<br/>
You're the fall guy<br/>
In the corner<br/>
Of my gloom<br/>
It feels like<br/>
Everything I see<br/>
Is nothing new<br/>
I got you caught in my eye, again<br/>
<br/>
There's a door there<br/>
That opens<br/>
Without you<br/>
And the door lies<br/>
With its open keys<br/>
To my room<br/>
<br/>
Flames of the torch light<br/>
Fill my thighs fulfill<br/>
As I crave I consume 'em<br/>
But I don't give<br/>
I got you caught in my eye, again<br/>
<br/>
Well I've got you caught in my eye<br/>
Well I've got you caught in my eye, again</p>

</div><h2>Night Time</h2><div class="lyrics">
<!--sse-->
<p>One, two, three, four<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Night time<br/>
Out my window<br/>
With sad eye[?]on the stereo<br/>
Not feeling alright<br/>
<br/>
And life goes<br/>
On below<br/>
Watch the heat rise<br/>
From the barrio<br/>
And into my life<br/>
<br/>
Oh turn me on<br/>
Don't turn on me<br/>
Oh turn me on<br/>
Like a bright light in the big city<br/>
<br/>
If you walk a mile<br/>
In my shoes<br/>
What would you choose?<br/>
<br/>
Thought that I saw Lesra<br/>
Sitting on some steps<br/>
Thought that I saw Lesra then I wondered what was next<br/>
Thought that I saw Lesra she was sitting on a stone<br/>
Thought that I saw Lesra she was sitting all alone<br/>
Thought that I saw Lesra I got close it wasn't here<br/>
Thought that I saw Lesra she looked just like a bird<br/>
Thought that I saw Lesra<br/>
<br/>
I saw night time<br/>
Out my window<br/>
With sad eye[?]on the stereo<br/>
Not feeling alright<br/>
<br/>
And night time<br/>
Goes on below<br/>
Watch the heat rise<br/>
From the barrio<br/>
And into my life<br/>
<br/>
Oh turn me on<br/>
Don't turn on me<br/>
Oh turn me on<br/>
Like a bright light in the big city<br/>
<br/>
If you walk a mile<br/>
In my shoes<br/>
What would you choose?<br/>
<br/>
Would you stay<br/>
Away from me<br/>
Or would you come here<br/>
Into my arms<br/>
I won't do you harm<br/>
Oh forget about it child<br/>
<br/>
Night time<br/>
Out my window<br/>
With sad eye[?]on the stereo<br/>
Not doing alright</p>

</div><h2>Pearly Gates</h2><div class="lyrics">
<!--sse-->
<p>In my time of sorrow<br/>
Do you have a song that I could borrow?<br/>
All mine are worn out now<br/>
Dead and fallen out of my mouth, yeah<br/>
I need a melody<br/>
Something I could sail away on<br/>
I need a song to sing<br/>
Let my fire burn the stake on<br/>
<br/>
And I was wondering<br/>
On my judgment day<br/>
What song I'd be humming<br/>
In line for the pearly gates<br/>
<br/>
And In my time of dying<br/>
You know the choirs will be crying<br/>
Little girls with long hair<br/>
Throwing songs into the air<br/>
And everybody's taking pictures<br/>
Inside Saint John The Divine<br/>
But me I was just lighting candles<br/>
That hailed every name but mine<br/>
<br/>
And I was wondering<br/>
On my judgment day<br/>
What I would be wearing<br/>
In line for the pearly gates<br/>
<br/>
And baby angels come to me<br/>
Singing songs with no warning, they're singing<br/>
Sleep through this morning<br/>
Sleep in my child<br/>
And may your dreams become you<br/>
Oh forever while</p>

</div><h2>Downtowns Lights</h2><div class="lyrics">
<!--sse-->
<p>One two three four<br/>
<br/>
Mother, sister comfort me<br/>
Feel so wet and cold<br/>
And downtown's lights look like a fire<br/>
As I'm headed out in the snow<br/>
<br/>
You know I've gone to live one thousand lives<br/>
And to die one thousand deaths<br/>
But lately baby, got me scared<br/>
Ain't got too much left<br/>
<br/>
I watch the tide flying<br/>
Like a sparrow<br/>
I watch the lights dying<br/>
Off like dominoes<br/>
Uh-hoh<br/>
<br/>
And the church bells were ringing<br/>
And the church bells they cried<br/>
And the church bells sang inside my heart<br/>
The night before she died<br/>
<br/>
And Jesus came to me<br/>
He put a song into my ears<br/>
He said let it fall right out your mouth<br/>
For the whole wide world to hear<br/>
And so I opened wide and out came a tide<br/>
And I let them know what to follow<br/>
And I cried Mother, Sister won't you comfort me<br/>
Downtown's locked up for the night<br/>
And I don't have a key<br/>
<br/>
Mother, sister comfort me<br/>
Feel so wet and cold<br/>
And downtown's lights look like a fire<br/>
As I'm headed out towards the show<br/>
<br/>
You know I've gone to live one thousand lives<br/>
And to die one thousand deaths<br/>
But lately baby, got me scared<br/>
Ain't got too much left<br/>
<br/>
But the ones that I had spent with you<br/>
Were the best that I ever had<br/>
<br/>
One two three four</p>
