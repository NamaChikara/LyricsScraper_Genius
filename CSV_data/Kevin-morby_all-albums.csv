<p>[Verse 1]<br/>
Come to me now<br/>
Like you did then<br/>
Pretty and slow<br/>
Pretty and thin<br/>
Ain't got no friend<br/>
In a world so big<br/>
Ain't got no family<br/>
Ain't got no kin<br/>
Where do you go<br/>
Boy, when you die?<br/>
Is it pretty and slow?<br/>
Is it up real high? I don't want to know<br/>
<br/>
[Pre-Chorus]<br/>
I can't wait for the sun to go down<br/>
Tired of squinting at this god-awful town<br/>
I can't wait for that moon to rise<br/>
She's my friend, always been, you can see it in my eyes<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
That I love her<br/>
Yeah, I do<br/>
Oh, I love her<br/>
And she loves me too<br/>
<br/>
[Verse 2]<br/>
Come to me now<br/>
Like you did then<br/>
Pretty and slow<br/>
Pretty and thin<br/>
Where do you go<br/>
When you go out at night?<br/>
When will you come home?<br/>
What did you find?<br/>
Ain't got a friend<br/>
In a world like this<br/>
There is a fortress<br/>
Around my heart<br/>
Till death do we part<br/>
<br/>
[Pre-Chorus]<br/>
I can't wait for the sun to go down<br/>
Tired of squinting at this ugly little town<br/>
I can't wait for that moon to shine<br/>
She's my friend, always been, you can see it in my eyes<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
That I love her<br/>
Yeah, I do<br/>
Oh, I love her<br/>
And she loves me too<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
Oh, I love her<br/>
Yeah, I do<br/>
Yeah, I love her<br/>
And she loves me too<br/>
<br/>
[Bridge]<br/>
You'll burn in her sunlight<br/>
You'll freeze in her night<br/>
You will run that way forever<br/>
Like an echo<br/>
Come on, Mabel<br/>
<br/>
[Outro]<br/>
Come to me now</p>

<p>I never was someone that I liked<br/>
I never was someone that you know<br/>
Now the tears flow through my eyes<br/>
And the trouble fell like a snow<br/>
I never walked down an empty street<br/>
I never was someone you'd want to meet<br/>
Just to be a normal man<br/>
Just to go out shaking hands<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm walking hand in hand<br/>
With my self and with my sin<br/>
All alone on a crowded street<br/>
I never was someone you'd want to meet<br/>
Just to be a normal man<br/>
Just to go out making plans<br/>
All alone on a crowded street<br/>
I never was someone you'd want to meet<br/>

I never was someone that I liked<br/>
I never was someone that you know<br/>
Now the tears pull through my eyes<br/>
And the trouble fell like a snow<br/>

And you cried, crybaby<br/>
Come on cry, crybaby<br/>
And you cried, crybaby<br/>
Come on cry, crybaby<br/>

<p>I once loved a boy so smart and true<br/>
We would walk home every day from the school<br/>
He'd say, ""I think we could walk forever<br/>
Oh no, how 'bout just a little while?"" Okay<br/>
He would make me laugh like the devil, haha<br/>
He would pick me up like the child that I was<br/>
<br/>
In my time I'd like to stay young forever<br/>
Like a tide, the crest beneath sunny weather<br/>
May we fill these lungs with laughter (haha)<br/>
And we may shake these bones with style (watch me now)<br/>
And may we claim all that we're after (everything)<br/>
And may we do it wearing a smile<br/>
And may the breath we breathe be free<br/>
And for you to remain a part of me<br/>
Three, four<br/>
<br/>
[Interlude]<br/>
<br/>
I have loved many faces, many places<br/>
All aboard my train but depart at different stations<br/>
And some of them look the same<br/>
But none of them smell the same<br/>
And some of them will never change<br/>
While some of them are growing strange<br/>
And some of them are center stage<br/>
While some of them go and turn my page<br/>
And some are [?]<br/>
And some are diseased with rage<br/>
Oh, but all of them are aboard my train<br/>
But all of them are a friend of mine<br/>
And oh, my darling, can't you see?<br/>
Oh that, babe, oh, and you, are a part of me</p>

Everything I see<br/>

There's a door there<br/>
That opens<br/>
Without you<br/>
And the door lies<br/>
With its open keys<br/>
To my room<br/>

Flames of the torch light<br/>
Fill my thighs fulfill<br/>
As I crave I consume 'em<br/>

Sitting on some steps<br/>
Thought that I saw Lesra then I wondered what was next<br/>
Thought that I saw Lesra she was sitting on a stone<br/>

<p>In my time of sorrow<br/>
Do you have a song that I could borrow?<br/>
All mine are worn out now<br/>
Dead and fallen out of my mouth, yeah<br/>
I need a melody<br/>
Something I could sail away on<br/>
I need a song to sing<br/>
Let my fire burn the stake on<br/>
<br/>
And I was wondering<br/>
On my judgment day<br/>
What song I'd be humming<br/>
In line for the pearly gates<br/>
<br/>
And In my time of dying<br/>
You know the choirs will be crying<br/>
Little girls with long hair<br/>
Throwing songs into the air<br/>
And everybody's taking pictures<br/>
Inside Saint John The Divine<br/>
But me I was just lighting candles<br/>
That hailed every name but mine<br/>
<br/>
And I was wondering<br/>
On my judgment day<br/>
What I would be wearing<br/>
In line for the pearly gates<br/>
<br/>
And baby angels come to me<br/>
Singing songs with no warning, they're singing<br/>
Sleep through this morning<br/>
Sleep in my child<br/>
And may your dreams become you<br/>
Oh forever while</p>

And Jesus came to me<br/>
He put a song into my ears<br/>
He said let it fall right out your mouth<br/>
For the whole wide world to hear<br/>

Maybe there's a kingdom above the weather<br/>
Oh, and whether you're gonna get our name is up to him<br/>

If you ever hear that crying in the distance like some siren<br/>
Maybe there's a singer with no ring around their little finger, no love<br/>
And If I lose my voice<br/>
If I have no choice but to go quiet<br/>
Won't you sing for me a melody into the night there<br/>
Well, if I die too young, if the wolf he comes<br/>

And I was wondering 'bout its trumpeter<br/>
How he could get those horns to tongue<br/>
Something like<br/>
<br/>
Tears will gather in my eye<br/>
""Hold my head, and babe y'know I'll cry""<br/>
And I was thinking 'bout the places I'd been<br/>
With you always at my side<br/>
Like a baby, oh I held my head and cried<br/>
""C'mon Dorothy, y'know we could go all night""<br/>
<br/>
""Hey, it's nighttime and you know<br/>
It's getting cold so babe put on some clothes""<br/>
<br/>
Oh, let's go hit the town<br/>
And we could fill the room up with smoke<br/>
You know I got the first round<br/>
As we tell all those stories told<br/>
And I would pretend you were new<br/>
Like I was just introduced to you<br/>
And all the music in my ears<br/>
Sounds beautiful down here<br/>
<br/>
And I could hear that drummer roll<br/>
As I listened to that choir cry<br/>
And I could hear a guitar weeping<br/>
I could feel those pipers pipe<br/>
And all the beauty I couldn't see<br/>
Well it just cut me at my knees<br/>
And I was watching the old men fish<br/>
And they'd all give their catch away<br/>
And I could hear a woman singing<br/>
And I could feel that piano play<br/>
<br/>
Tears will gather in my eye<br/>
Hold my head, oh, and babe you know I'll cry<br/>
Like a baby, oh, I held my head and cried<br/>
C'mon Dorothy, you know we could go all night</p>

Riding on that ferris wheel<br/>

Transcending time and space<br/>

<p>Have you seen my lover<br/>
With her long blonde hair?<br/>
Everything we did just went so wrong<br/>
Last time that I saw her<br/>
She was standing there<br/>
Now I've come to wonder where she's gone<br/>
Where she's gone, lord<br/>
Where she's gone, lord<br/>
Now I've come to wonder where she's gone<br/>
<br/>
And have you seen my mother<br/>
She's out looking for my father?<br/>
Didn't think that she'd be gone this long<br/>
He's gone where you can't go<br/>
But I let her have her fun<br/>
Now I've come to wonder where she's gone<br/>
Where she's gone, lord<br/>
Where she's gone, lord<br/>
Now I've come to wonder where she's gone<br/>
<br/>
And what about my sister<br/>
She looks just like me<br/>
Looking into her is like a mirror<br/>
And when we were young<br/>
We weren't two but one<br/>
Sometimes I come to wonder where she's gone<br/>
Where she's gone, lord<br/>
Where she's gone<br/>
<br/>
Without a kingdom<br/>
Without a bird over my head<br/>
Don't believe what they told you<br/>
Believe what you heard<br/>
Or what I said<br/>
And now I go down towards the water<br/>
In which we cried<br/>
And now I go down towards the dirt<br/>
In which we died, died, died, died<br/>
<br/>
Destroyer<br/>
Destroyer<br/>
<br/>
And, oh, what about me?<br/>
I'm out wandering the streets<br/>
Silently carrying a song<br/>
Until it gets too loud<br/>
And it comes rushing out of my mouth<br/>
Oh, you'll probably wonder where I've gone<br/>
Where I've gone, lord<br/>
Where I've gone, lord<br/>
Oh, you'll probably wonder where I've gone<br/>

There goes, there goes my head<br/>
There goes my head<br/>
Throw ten on in, in the swear jar<br/>
In the swear jar<br/>
Outside storms cry, inside now<br/>
Not much better, stormy weather<br/>
I am writing a song book on a mountain<br/>
<br/>
In the garden where we built a home<br/>
Black flowers<br/>
In the stories, the lies that they wrote<br/>
Escape me<br/>
And the winged horses that we once rode<br/>
Have stopped breathing<br/>

In the garden where we built a home<br/>
Black flowers<br/>

In the garden where we built a home<br/>
And the stories, the lies that they wrote<br/>
And the winged horses that we once rode<br/>
Are all strung out and spun out y'know<br/>
<br/>
In the garden where built a home<br/>
And the roads that we built all corrode<br/>
In the garden where we built a home<br/>
Once a river, a sea now a mote<br/>
<br/>
And the black flowers grow all around<br/>
And the angels who died in our sound<br/>
Now nothing will come of this now<br/>
For nothing can grow from the ground<br/>
<br/>
And no one we know now will save us<br/>
Like no one we know would try<br/>
Like everything once is now over<br/>
Just as everything once has died<br/>
<br/>
In the garden where we built a home<br/>
And all those we kept in tow<br/>
The weeper with his tiny piano<br/>
The willow with her singing saw<br/>
The jeweler with her cast iron hammer<br/>
<br/>
Oh, the ivy, the crows, and the law<br/>
<br/>
In the garden where we built a home<br/>
All's dark inside the tower<br/>
In the garden where we built a home<br/>

<p>My body was sleeping<br/>
While my poor mind was dreaming<br/>
When they woke me up I didn't know that I'd been screaming<br/>
And my old heart was pounding, for the devil had found me<br/>
Trapped me in a corner of my mind<br/>
And my legs were both shaking<br/>
From the pain they'd been taking<br/>
Picked my body up, and aimed for home<br/>
But these boots have seen better<br/>
Can't make sense of this weather<br/>
Rolling over me, up in the sky<br/>
But I was warm like a fire<br/>
For I was full of desire to hold on, to not let go<br/>
Thought of friends, thought of family<br/>
And all who surround me<br/>
Those enemies I danced with, so long ago<br/>
Let them know<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
If you find water, please call my name<br/>
Put me out like a fire, cover me in rain<br/>
<br/>
Thought of stars and the planets<br/>
Wondered how they could have planned this<br/>
And what were they thinking<br/>
How could they have known?<br/>
I felt small but full of pride<br/>
I felt tall for my size<br/>
My eyes were black and fixed on the night<br/>
And your name just hung<br/>
From a song I had sung<br/>
There in the air<br/>
Suspended by beauty<br/>
There are words that get spoken<br/>
Oh, and lives the leave broken<br/>
Some stone breaks in half<br/>
And some stones shatters<br/>
But my speech had been fleeting<br/>
Like the company I'd been keeping<br/>
I never asked for their names and they never asked for mine<br/>
Just a polluted highway<br/>
Or a clouded skyway<br/>
I'm a mess I confess, now send me the maid<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
If you find water, please call my name<br/>
Put me on like a fire, cover me in rain<br/>
<br/>
Thought of stages with their singers<br/>
Oh, and painters with their fingers<br/>
I was strong like a horse in carrying my song<br/>
To drop it off in some stable<br/>
When I was young I was able<br/>
To never turn around, to never look behind<br/>
To grow old, to grow distant<br/>
Like a mare in the distance<br/>
Bothering no one, so let her live<br/>
Until she dies<br/>
Picture lilies, picture willows<br/>
And a wild open window<br/>
To a room with a view, and both of us laughing<br/>
Just children so young<br/>
Oh, at least in the scheme<br/>
With our hair still there<br/>
And you keep my teeth clean<br/>
I sing who is my creator<br/>
Not my mother<br/>
Not my father<br/>
But before the universe burst wide on open<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
If you find water, please call my name<br/>
Put me on like a fire, cover me in rain<br/>
If you find water, won't you call my name?<br/>
Put me on like a fire, cover me in rain</p>

I'll be back, somebody in there in a fever, a pearl [?]<br/>
<br/>
And why’d you let me walk on that wild side<br/>
With my head in the air full of some child's pride<br/>
Let the sun come up, let the sun rise<br/>
As it rips the curtain of your eye<br/>
<br/>
And oh my lover, is it always the same<br/>
With your pointing your finger the way that I came<br/>
Oh my lover, you never call my bluff<br/>
Gave what you have now, but it was never enough<br/>
Never enough<br/>
<br/>
And oh the places you'll go<br/>
And oh the things that you'll do<br/>
Oh just to have and to hold<br/>
But now you must move<br/>
<br/>
And oh the places you'll go<br/>
And oh the things that you'll do<br/>
And oh the hand that you hold<br/>
Does not belong to you</p>

<p>Harlem River, talk to me<br/>
Tell me what you think about<br/>
Harlem River I'm in love, love, love, love<br/>
<br/>
Harlem River talk to me<br/>
Where we heading now?<br/>
Harlem River I'm in love, love, love, love<br/>
<br/>
All because of you<br/>
<br/>
In my pearl and my diamond shoes<br/>
I've climbed the cloud that will store the moon<br/>
On the river<br/>
All because of you<br/>
<br/>
Harlem River swallow me<br/>
Put your hands around my neck<br/>
Harlem River, I can't breath<br/>
You've got the lights down now<br/>
<br/>
And Harlem River, give me wings<br/>
Put my head up in the clouds<br/>
And Harlem River all because<br/>
Oh, I know where now<br/>
<br/>
Harlem River, tell me, is it true?<br/>
That in my pearl and my diamonds<br/>
I've climbed the cloud, now I store the moon<br/>
Harlem River, all because of you<br/>
<br/>
I don't know I don't know<br/>
Just where I'm going<br/>
Cause I've never been<br/>
And I don't know<br/>
Just where I'm going<br/>
Or where I've been<br/>
Oh, Harlem River, like a diamond<br/>
<br/>
And ride on that easy rider<br/>
Flow like that Harlem River<br/>
Ride on that easy rider<br/>
Flow like that Harlem River<br/>
<br/>
I ride for you<br/>
I ride for you</p>

<p>Slow train<br/>
Don't you know my pain<br/>
Swim through my veins<br/>
On a slow train<br/>
<br/>
I am lost all around<br/>
I am barely on the ground<br/>
Around the bed comes a slow train<br/>
Train<br/>
<br/>
Release the fire out of me<br/>
I don't wanna burn from the inside<br/>
And I don't know my name<br/>
And I don't know my purpose<br/>
I just know my place on the slow train<br/>
<br/>
Standing on the platform, waiting for that train<br/>
Son, you are too late now, train already came<br/>
Waiting out the rain now, waiting for that sun<br/>
I'm waiting on a train that's already gone<br/>
Gone<br/>
<br/>
Release the fire out of me<br/>
I don't wanna burn from the inside<br/>
And I don't know my name<br/>
And I don't know my purpose<br/>
I just know my place on the slow train<br/>
<br/>
A slow train coming, a slow train gone<br/>
A slow train coming, a slow train gone<br/>
A slow train coming, a slow train gone<br/>
A slow train coming, a slow train gone</p>

<!--sse-->
<p>When I was young, just under 21<br/>
I tore my town apart by emptying my<br/>
Loaded gun<br/>
Into the atmosphere, catching bodies<br/>
Along the way<br/>
And now the lord can't help me, and<br/>
There ain't no god to save<br/>
A wretch like me<br/>
<br/>
My family is upset but I'm still their<br/>
Baby boy<br/>
Who's never gone now here alone, but<br/>
Now I ain't got no choice<br/>
I'm going down, I'm going down, down<br/>
Down<br/>
O, but I don't wanna go to hell, no I<br/>
Don't wanna go to hell...<br/>
<br/>
But if the devil is a bully, then I guess I<br/>
Might as well still be alive<br/>
<br/>
And at the football games, everyone will<br/>
Know my name<br/>
Won't matter if they're local, or they're in<br/>
From outta state<br/>
""O that innocent boy turned dangerous<br/>
Who went to the mall that day -<br/>
He grew up in the foothills, he went to<br/>
That mall to slay""<br/>
And like a bad dream, that feels so real<br/>
That it can't be, but it is still<br/>
And like a nightmare taken out of sleep<br/>
It hits you in the morning like a<br/>
Newspaper at your feet<br/>
<br/>
My name will reign<br/>
<br/>
Cryin on my mama's shoulders holdin<br/>
My daddy's hand<br/>
Look into my sister's eyes, I know it's<br/>
Hard to understand<br/>
That what I did, won't be forgiven, and<br/>
What I did, is neverending<br/>
<br/>
But look up at the school and tell me<br/>
What do you see?<br/>
There's something wrong with all of<br/>
Them, there's nothing wrong with me<br/>
<br/>
My name will reign</p>

A coyote, no path<br/>
Like a sucker in the void<br/>
All future, no past<br/>

A wolf with no pack<br/>
Like a sucker in the void<br/>

To nowhere now, nowhere now<br/>
To, to be found, to be found<br/>
On the lone mile<br/>

Blind like a plane<br/>
Wrapped up in a cloud<br/>
Choking on that smoke<br/>
Drowning in that sound<br/>
Like a sucker in the void<br/>
No place to call home<br/>
Like a sucker in the void<br/>
No one to return<br/>

Kevin Morby,Harlem River,The Dead They Dont Come Back,0,"<div class=""lyrics"">

<p>On my way to work<br/>
I noticed that<br/>
I passed a cemetery<br/>
Oh lord I held my breath<br/>
Dead they don't come back<br/>
Dead they don't come back<br/>
Dead they don't, dead they don't, dead they don't come back<br/>
<br/>
And on my way to school<br/>
I passed that old graveyard<br/>
Life is mighty lonely<br/>
And life is mighty hard<br/>
Dead they don't wake up<br/>
Dead they don't wake up<br/>
Dead they don't, dead they don't, dead they don't wake up<br/>
<br/>
Oh I am on a ride<br/>
Measure the distance in time<br/>
<br/>
I can see your teardrops<br/>
Behind that black black veil<br/>
Made me hope for heaven<br/>
And me scared for hell<br/>
Dead they all will sleep<br/>
Dead they all will sleep<br/>
Dead they all, the dead they all, the dead they all will sleep<br/>
<br/>
And from time to time<br/>
I think about my grave<br/>
When I'm gonna have one<br/>
And what's it gonna say<br/>
It feels good to rest<br/>
It's been a long long day<br/>
It's been a long, it's been a long, it's been a long long day<br/>
<br/>
Oh I am on a ride<br/>
Measure the distance in time<br/>
And as sure as I was born<br/>
I will die<br/>
<br/>
And on my way back home<br/>
Stopped at your tombstone<br/>
Said a prayer for you<br/>
I was tired and alone<br/>
Said lord I miss my friend<br/>
Who's underneath my feet<br/>
May her soul, oh may her soul, oh may her soul rest in peace</p>
