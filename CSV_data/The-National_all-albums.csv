<p>[Verse 1]<br/>
You said we're not so tied together<br/>
What did you mean?<br/>
Meet me in the stairwell in a second<br/>
For a glass of gin<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
Nobody else will be there then<br/>
Nobody else will be there<br/>
Nobody else will be there then<br/>
Nobody else will be there<br/>
<br/>
[Verse 2]<br/>
Can you remind me the building you live in<br/>
I'm on my way<br/>
It's getting cold again but New York's gorgeous<br/>
It's a subway day<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
Nobody else will be there then<br/>
Nobody else will be there<br/>
Nobody else will be there then<br/>
Nobody else will be there<br/>
<br/>
[Verse 3]<br/>
Why are we still out here?<br/>
Holding our coats<br/>
We look like children<br/>
Goodbyes always take us half an hour<br/>
Can't we just go home?<br/>
<br/>
[Verse 4]<br/>
Hey baby, where were you back there<br/>
When I needed your help?<br/>
I thought that if I stuck my neck out<br/>
I'd get you out of your shell<br/>
My faith is sick and my skin is thin as ever<br/>
I need you alone<br/>
Goodbyes always take us half an hour<br/>
Can't we just go home?<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
Nobody else will be there then<br/>
Nobody else will be there<br/>
Nobody else will be there then<br/>
Nobody else will be there</p>

<p>[Verse 1]<br/>
I don't need you, I don't need you<br/>
Besides I barely ever see you anymore<br/>
And when I do it feels like you're only halfway there<br/>
Young mothers love me even ghosts of<br/>
Girlfriends call from Cleveland<br/>
They will meet me anytime and anywhere<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
The day I die, the day I die<br/>
Where will we be?<br/>
The day I die, the day I die<br/>
Where will we be?<br/>
<br/>
[Verse 2]<br/>
Don't do this, I don't do this to you<br/>
Don't expect me to enjoy it<br/>
'Cause I really don't have the courage not to turn the volume up inside my ears<br/>
For years I used to put my head inside the speakers<br/>
In the hallway when you get too high and talk forever<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
The day I die, the day I die<br/>
Where will we be?<br/>
The day I die, the day I die<br/>
Where will we be?<br/>
<br/>
The day I die, the day I die<br/>
Where will we be?<br/>
The day I die, the day I die<br/>
Where will we be?<br/>
<br/>
[Verse 3]<br/>
I get a little punchy with the vodka just like my great uncle Valentine Jester did<br/>
But he had to deal with those people like you who made no goddamn common sense<br/>
I’d rather walk all the way home right now than to spend one more second in this place<br/>
I’m exactly like you Valentine, just come outside and leave with me<br/>
<br/>
[Bridge]<br/>
Let's just get high enough to see our problems<br/>
Let’s just get high enough to see our fathers’ houses<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
The day I die, the day I die<br/>
Where will we be?<br/>
The day I die, the day I die<br/>
Where will we be?<br/>
<br/>
The day I die, the day I die<br/>
Where will we be?<br/>
The day I die, the day I die<br/>
Where will we be?</p>

I’m always thinking about useless things<br/>
I’m always checking out<br/>
I’m always mothering myself to bits<br/>
I’m always checking out<br/>

[Pre-Chorus]<br/>
Forget it, nothing I change changes anything<br/>
I won't let it, I won't let it ruin my hair<br/>

I only take up a little of the collapsing space<br/>
I better cut this off<br/>
Don’t wanna fuck it up<br/>
I only take up a little of the collapsing space<br/>
I better cut this off<br/>
Don’t wanna fuck up the place<br/>

I better walk it back, walk it back<br/>
Oh, I better walk it back, walk it back<br/>
Walk it back, walk it back<br/>

[Verse 2]<br/>
I try to save it for a rainy day<br/>
It’s raining all the time<br/>
Until everything is less insane<br/>
I’m mixing weed with wine<br/>
<br/>
[Pre-Chorus]<br/>
Forget it, nothing I change changes anything<br/>
I won't let it, I won't let it ruin my hair<br/>

Oh, I better walk it back, walk it back<br/>
Walk it back, walk it back<br/>

[Sampled speech]<br/>
""People like you are still living in what we call the reality-based community.  You believe that solutions emerge from your judicious study of discernible reality. That's not the way the world really works anymore. We're an empire now, and when we act, we create our own reality. And while you are studying that reality - judiciously, as you will - we'll act again, creating other new realities, which you can study too, and that's how things will sort out.  We're history's actors, and you, all of you, will be left to just study what we do<br/>
<br/>
Apparently that was written on a whiteboard with a red sharpie in the Roosevelt bedroom, sometime around Christmas 2007. Yeah, so I can't stay...""<br/>
<br/>
[Outro]<br/>
I can't stay and I can't come back<br/>
I'll just keep awake<br/>
And I won't react<br/>
I'll walk through Lawrencetown<br/>
Along the tracks<br/>
My own body in my arms<br/>
But I won't collapse<br/>
So don't go dark on me<br/>
It's all alright<br/>
If I'm gonna get back to you, someday<br/>
I'll need your light</p>

Maybe I listen more than you think<br/>
And I can tell that somebody sold you<br/>
We said we’d never let anyone in<br/>
We said we’d only die of lonely secrets<br/>

[Pre-Chorus]<br/>
The system only dreams in total darkness<br/>
Why are you hiding from me?<br/>
We’re in a different kind of thing now<br/>
All night you’re talking to God<br/>
<br/>
[Verse 2]<br/>
I thought that this would all work out after a while<br/>
Now you’re saying that I’m asking for too much attention<br/>
Also no other faith is light enough for this place<br/>
We said we’d only die of lonely secrets<br/>

The system only dreams in total darkness<br/>
Why are you hiding from me?<br/>

Crushed on the train<br/>
We'd stand by the window<br/>
Sweat through the hard parts of June<br/>
We hugged it out and ducked it on purpose<br/>
Nothing else I needed to do<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
I was born, born to beg for you<br/>
<br/>
[Verse 2]<br/>
Later that year in the back of the Warsaw<br/>
I thought you and I might be okay<br/>
Spinning and quiet<br/>
You leaned in against me<br/>
Said, ""I'm gonna have it all some day.""<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
I was born to beg for you<br/>
I was born, born to beg for you<br/>

[Break]<br/>
New York is older<br/>
And changing its skin again<br/>
It dies every ten years<br/>
And then it begins again<br/>
If your heart was in it<br/>
I'd stay a minute<br/>
I'm dying to be taken apart<br/>

Oh my Mother, let your daughter dance with me<br/>
I'd like to spin her wild around the cottonwood tree<br/>
There's something about her eyes, I think her roots are rotten<br/>
This must be the reason she wears her hair up in knots, oh no<br/>

[Pre-Chorus]<br/>
This is so embarrassing<br/>
Ah, we're pissing fits<br/>
Crying on our doorsteps in t-shirts loose and ripped<br/>
Some of them so out of style I cannot save them<br/>
They'll just get whatever my salvation gave them<br/>

Keep the weed next to the bed<br/>
Light the water, check for lead<br/>
Dim the lights a little lower<br/>
Hide your backbone, shrug your shoulders<br/>
Give the gift that fits your head<br/>
You have to get this turtleneck<br/>

The poor, they leave their cellphones in the bathrooms of the rich<br/>
And when they try to turn them off everything they switch to<br/>

You've been sleeping for miles<br/>
So what did you see?<br/>
Here the sky's been falling white flowers<br/>
And there's ice in all the trees<br/>
I've been tapping the table<br/>
I've been hoping to drink<br/>
There's a line that goes all the way from my childhood to you<br/>

Can't you find a way?<br/>
Can't you find a way?<br/>
You are in this too<br/>

I've been trying to see where you're going, but you're so hard to follow<br/>
And I don't think we're getting anywhere any time soon<br/>
We have so much to cover and I don't know what I'm expecting<br/>
You just keep saying so many things that I wish you won't<br/>

Can't you find a way?<br/>
Can't you find a way?<br/>

I've been talking about you to myself<br/>
Cause there's nobody else<br/>
And I want what I want<br/>
And I want everything<br/>

It's so easy to set off<br/>
The molecules and the caplets<br/>
They all have something against me<br/>
Nothing I do makes me feel different<br/>

[Pre-Chorus 1]<br/>
This one's like your sister's best friends in a bath calling you to join them<br/>
Can't avoid them<br/>
This one's like your mother's arms when she was young and sunburned in the '80s<br/>
It lasts forever<br/>

The more level they have me<br/>
The more I cannot stand me<br/>
I have helpless friendships<br/>
And bad taste in liquids<br/>

This one's like the wilderness without the world<br/>
I'm gonna miss those long nights with the windows open<br/>

Like a baby<br/>

I can't find a lighter anywhere I'm going crazy<br/>

I swear you got a little bit taller since I saw you<br/>
I'll still destroy you<br/>

Offered them some bottled water, then they cut them down<br/>
I came back to see if you were here, but everything was different<br/>
Your voice was low, you blended in, I could barely hear you speak<br/>
You were always my last second bright spot in the distance<br/>
Thought that you were something good<br/>
That I would always keep<br/>

I'll still destroy you someday, sleep well, beast; you as well, beast<br/>
I'll still destroy you someday, sleep well, beast; you as well, beast<br/>

<p>[Verse 1]<br/>
Gold light breaks behind the houses<br/>
I don't see what's strange about this<br/>
Tiny bubbles hang above me<br/>
It's a sign that someone loves me<br/>
I can hardly stand upright<br/>
Hit my head up on the light<br/>
I have faith but don't believe it<br/>
It's not there enough to leave it<br/>
<br/>
[Pre-Chorus]<br/>
Everything I love is on the table<br/>
Everything I love is out to sea<br/>
<br/>
[Verse 2]<br/>
I have only two emotions<br/>
Careful fear and dead devotion<br/>
I can't get the balance right<br/>
With all my marbles in the fight<br/>
I see all the ones I wept for<br/>
All the things I had it in for<br/>
I won't cry until I hear<br/>
Cause I was not supposed to be here<br/>
<br/>
[Pre-Chorus]<br/>
Everything I love is on the table<br/>
Everything I love is out to sea<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
I'm not alone<br/>
I'll never be<br/>
And to the bone<br/>
I'm evergreen<br/>
<br/>
[Verse 3]<br/>
I'm tired, I'm freezing, I'm dumb<br/>
When it gets so late I forget everyone<br/>
I need somewhere to stay<br/>
Don't think anybody I know is awake<br/>
Calm down, it's alright<br/>
Keep my arms the rest of the night<br/>
When they ask what do I see<br/>
I say ""a bright white beautiful heaven hanging over me""<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
I'm not alone<br/>
I'll never be<br/>
And to the bone<br/>
I'm evergreen<br/>
And if you want (dead seriously)<br/>
To see me cry (don't swallow the cap)<br/>
Play ""Let It Be"" (pat yourself on the back)<br/>
Or ""Nevermind"" (dead seriously)<br/>
<br/>
[Verse 4]<br/>
Is it time to leave? Is it time to think about…<br/>
What I wanna say to the girls at the door<br/>
I need somewhere to be<br/>
But I can't get around the river in front of me<br/>
Calm down, it's alright<br/>
Lead my arms the rest of the night<br/>
When they ask what do I see<br/>
I say ""a bright white beautiful heaven hanging over me""<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
I'm not alone (dead seriously)<br/>
I'll never be (don't swallow the cap)<br/>

I'm in the city you hated, my eyes are falling<br/>
Counting the clicks with the living dead, my eyes are red<br/>
I'm in the crush and I hate it, my eyes are falling<br/>
I'm having trouble inside my skin, I tried to keep my skeletons in<br/>
Is it weird to be back in the South? And can they even tell<br/>
That the city girl was ever there, or anywhere?<br/>
I'm having trouble inside my skin, I tried to keep my skeletons in<br/>
I'll be a friend and a fuck-up and everything<br/>
But I'll never be anything you ever want me to be<br/>

I don't need any help to be breakable, believe me<br/>
I know nobody else who can laugh along to any kind of joke<br/>

It'll be easy to cover, gather my skeletons far inside<br/>
It'll be summer in Dallas before I realize<br/>

I don't want you to grieve, but I want you to sympathize, alright<br/>
I can't blame you for losing, your mind for a little while, so did I<br/>
I don't want you to change, but I want you to recognize that I<br/>

You keep changing your fancy, fancy mind<br/>
Every time I decide to let go<br/>

Boning up and reading the American Dictionary<br/>

Put the water out and donned a marigold<br/>

And tie one on you<br/>

When the red comes over you?<br/>

Or whatever you call it<br/>

<p>[Verse 1]<br/>
When I think of you in the city, the sight of you among the sites<br/>
I get this sudden sinking feeling of a man about to fly<br/>
Never kept me up before, now I’ve been awake for days<br/>
I can’t fight it anymore, I’m going through an awkward phase<br/>
I am secretly in love with everyone that I grew up with<br/>
Do my crying underwater, I can’t get down any farther<br/>
All my drowning friends can see, now there is no running from it<br/>
It’s become the crux of me, I wish that I could rise above it<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
But I stay down with my demons<br/>
But I stay down with my demons<br/>
<br/>
[Verse 2]<br/>
Buts and buzzards in the sky, alligators in the sewers<br/>
I don’t even wonder why, hide among the younger viewers<br/>
Huddle with them all night long, the worried talk to God goes on<br/>
I sincerely tried to love it, wish that I could rise above it<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
But I stay down with my demons<br/>
But I stay down with my demons<br/>

Can I stay here? I can sleep on the floor<br/>
Paint the blood and hang the palms on the door<br/>
Do not think I’m going places anymore<br/>
Wanna see the sun come up above New York<br/>
Oh, every day I start so great, then the sunlight dims<br/>
The less I look, the more I see the pythons in the limbs<br/>
Do not know what’s wrong with me, the sour is in the cut<br/>
When I walk into a room, I do not light it up<br/>
Fuck<br/>

So I stay down with my demons<br/>
I stay down with my demons<br/>
I stay down with my demons<br/>

Gold light breaks behind the houses<br/>
I don't see what's strange about this<br/>
Tiny bubbles hang above me<br/>
It's a sign that someone loves me<br/>
I can hardly stand upright<br/>
Hit my head up on the light<br/>
I have faith but don't believe it<br/>

Careful fear and dead devotion<br/>

All the things I had it in for<br/>
I won't cry until I hear<br/>

When it gets so late I forget everyone<br/>
I need somewhere to stay<br/>
Don't think anybody I know is awake<br/>
Calm down, it's alright<br/>
Keep my arms the rest of the night<br/>
When they ask what do I see<br/>
I say ""a bright white beautiful heaven hanging over me""<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
I'm not alone<br/>
I'll never be<br/>
And to the bone<br/>
I'm evergreen<br/>
And if you want (dead seriously)<br/>
To see me cry (don't swallow the cap)<br/>
Play ""Let It Be"" (pat yourself on the back)<br/>
Or ""Nevermind"" (dead seriously)<br/>

Is it time to leave? Is it time to think about…<br/>
What I wanna say to the girls at the door<br/>
I need somewhere to be<br/>
But I can't get around the river in front of me<br/>
Calm down, it's alright<br/>
Lead my arms the rest of the night<br/>
When they ask what do I see<br/>
I say ""a bright white beautiful heaven hanging over me""<br/>

<p>[Verse 1]<br/>
I'm in the city you hated, my eyes are falling<br/>
Counting the clicks with the living dead, my eyes are red<br/>
I'm in the crush and I hate it, my eyes are falling<br/>
I'm having trouble inside my skin, I tried to keep my skeletons in<br/>
Is it weird to be back in the South? And can they even tell<br/>
That the city girl was ever there, or anywhere?<br/>
I'm having trouble inside my skin, I tried to keep my skeletons in<br/>
I'll be a friend and a fuck-up and everything<br/>
But I'll never be anything you ever want me to be<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
I keep coming back here, where everything slipped<br/>
But I will not spill my guts out<br/>
I keep coming back here, where everything slipped<br/>
But I will not spill my guts out<br/>

[Verse 2]<br/>
I don't need any help to be breakable, believe me<br/>
I know nobody else who can laugh along to any kind of joke<br/>
I won't need any help to be lonely when you leave me<br/>
It'll be easy to cover, gather my skeletons far inside<br/>
It'll be summer in Dallas before I realize<br/>
<br/>
[Verse 3]<br/>
I don't want you to grieve, but I want you to sympathize, alright<br/>
I can't blame you for losing, your mind for a little while, so did I<br/>
I don't want you to change, but I want you to recognize that I<br/>
It'll be easy to cover, gather your skeletons far inside<br/>
It'll be summer in Dallas before you realize<br/>
That I'll never be anything you ever want me to be<br/>

I retired to the briars, by the pool, it gets so loud<br/>
If I die this instant, taken from the distance<br/>
They will probably list it down among other things 'round town<br/>
Got my rings around me, I got baby to pound me<br/>

In the skies over black Venice, I see eyes of a white menace<br/>
The surprise of the week is that I never heard the sound<br/>

And all the L.A. women fall asleep while swimming<br/>
I got paid to fish 'em out and then, one day, I lost the job<br/>
And I cried a little, I got fried a little<br/>
Then she laid her eyes on mine<br/>
And she said, ""Babe, you're better off""<br/>
I got my rings around me, I got baby to pound me<br/>

Burn yourself alive and join the monster squad<br/>

And if you had another wish to wish<br/>
You'd be fun and moving<br/>

But you can't talk to people, right?<br/>
You can't tell a story<br/>

She lives in the place<br/>
In the side of our lives<br/>
Where nothing is<br/>
Ever put straight<br/>
She turns herself round<br/>
And she smiles and she says<br/>
'This is it'<br/>

'That's the end of the joke'<br/>
And loses herself<br/>
In her dreaming and sleep<br/>
And her lovers walk<br/>
Through in their coats<br/>

Pretty in pink<br/>

Pretty in pink<br/>

All of her lovers<br/>
All talk of her notes<br/>
And the flowers<br/>
That they never sent<br/>
And wasn't she easy<br/>
And isn't she<br/>
Pretty in pink<br/>
The one who insists<br/>
He was first in the line<br/>
Is the last to<br/>
Remember her name<br/>
He's walking around<br/>
In this dress<br/>
That she wore<br/>
She is gone<br/>

Nothing you can touch<br/>
She waves<br/>
She buttons your shirt<br/>

She hands you this coat<br/>

I don't mind painting my back with the past<br/>
Pictures in resolute pain<br/>
Smoothing the laugh o'er the lane<br/>

But if it happens to you<br/>
The same kind of deal<br/>
I recommend fire<br/>
Instead of the fool<br/>

I don't mind shaking your hand at the door<br/>
If only to be a resolute man (Pictures in resolute pain)<br/>
If only to be a resolute man<br/>

Hole in the middle, I'm seeing less of you<br/>
Now I'm not going anywhere and I don't know what I'll do<br/>

But when I look out the window I see Girls on TV<br/>
Living and dying in L.A. and it means nothing to me<br/>

She said you're right, it's a living, but you're wrong for the life<br/>
You know you never should've listened to my father's advice<br/>

I gave my heart to the Army<br/>
The only sentimental thing I could think of<br/>
With cousins, and colours and somewhere overseas<br/>
But it'll take a better war to kill a college man like me<br/>
<br/>
I'm too tired to drive anywhere, anyway right now<br/>
Do you care if I stay?<br/>
You can put on your bathing suits<br/>
And I'll try to find somethin' on this thing that means nothin' enough<br/>
Losin' my breath, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo<br/>
Losin' my breath, doo doo doo doo doo doo doo<br/>
<br/>
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld<br/>
I want to sit in and die<br/>
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld<br/>
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo<br/>
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld<br/>
I want to sit in and die<br/>
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld<br/>
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo<br/>
<br/>
This pricey stuff makes me dizzy<br/>
I guess I've always been a delicate man<br/>
Takes me a day to remember a day<br/>
I didn't mean to let it get so far out of hand<br/>
I was a comfortable kid<br/>
But I don't think about it much anymore<br/>
Lay me on the table, put flowers in my mouth<br/>
And we can say that we invented a summer lovin' torture party<br/>
<br/>
I'm too tired to drive anywhere, anyway right now<br/>
Do you care if I stay?<br/>
You can put on your bathing suits<br/>
And I'll try to find something on this thing that means nothin' enough<br/>
<br/>
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld<br/>
I want to sit in and die<br/>
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld<br/>
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo<br/>
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld<br/>
I want to sit in and die<br/>
You and your sister live in a Lemonworld<br/>
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo<br/>
<br/>
Losin' my breath<br/>
Doo doo doo doo doo doo</p>

<p>[Verse 1]<br/>
There's no saving anything<br/>
Now we're swallowing the shine of the summer<br/>
There's no saving anything<br/>
How we swallow the sun<br/>
<br/>
[Pre-Chorus]<br/>
But I won't be no runaway<br/>
Cause I won't run<br/>
No I won't be no runaway<br/>
What makes you think I'm enjoying being led to the flood?<br/>
We got another thing coming undone<br/>
And its taking us over<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
We don't bleed when we don't fight<br/>
Go ahead, go ahead<br/>
Throw your arms in the air tonight<br/>
We don't bleed when we don't fight<br/>
Go ahead, go ahead<br/>
Lose our shirts in the fire tonight<br/>
What makes you think I'm enjoying being led to the flood?<br/>
We got another thing coming undone<br/>

[Pre-Chorus]<br/>
But I won't be no runaway<br/>
Cause I won't run<br/>

Go ahead, go ahead<br/>
Lose our shirts in the fire tonight<br/>
What makes you think I'm enjoying being led to the flood?<br/>
We got another thing coming undone<br/>
We got another thing coming undone<br/>
And it's taking forever<br/>
<br/>
[Verse 2]<br/>
I'll go braving everything<br/>
With you swallowing the shine of the summer<br/>
I'll go braving everything<br/>
Through the shine of the sun<br/>
<br/>

But I won't be no runaway<br/>
Cause I won't run<br/>
No I won't be no runaway<br/>

<p>[Verse 1]<br/>
I think the kids are in trouble<br/>
I do not know what all the troubles are for<br/>
Give them ice for their fevers<br/>
You're the only thing I ever want anymore<br/>
Live on coffee and flowers<br/>
And try not to wonder what the weather will be<br/>
I figured out what we're missing<br/>
I tell you miserable things after you are asleep<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
Now we'll leave the Silver City<br/>
'Cause all the silver girls<br/>
Gave us black dreams<br/>
Leave the Silver City<br/>
To all the silver girls<br/>
Everything means everything<br/>
<br/>
[Verse 2]<br/>
It's a Hollywood summer<br/>
You'll never believe the shitty thoughts I think<br/>
Meet our friends out for dinner<br/>
When I said what I said, I didn't mean anything<br/>
We belong in a movie<br/>
Try to hold it together until our friends are gone<br/>
We should swim in a fountain<br/>
Do not want to disappoint anyone<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
Now we'll leave the Silver City<br/>
'Cause all the silver girls<br/>
Gave us black dreams<br/>
Leave the Silver City<br/>
To all the silver girls<br/>
Everything means everything<br/>

[Bridge]<br/>
I was afraid<br/>
I'd eat your brains<br/>
I was afraid<br/>
I'd eat your brains<br/>
'Cause I'm evil<br/>
'Cause I'm evil<br/>
<br/>
[Verse 3]<br/>
I'm a confident liar<br/>
Have my head in the oven so you'll know where I'll be<br/>
I try to be more romantic<br/>
I want to believe in everything you believe<br/>
If I was less than amazing<br/>
I do not know what all the troubles are for<br/>
Fall asleep in your branches<br/>
You're the only thing I ever want anymore<br/>
<br/>
[Chorus]<br/>
Now we'll leave the Silver City<br/>
'Cause all the silver girls<br/>
Gave us black dreams<br/>
Leave the Silver City<br/>
To all the silver girls<br/>
Everything means everything<br/>

I was afraid<br/>
I'd eat your brains<br/>
I was afraid<br/>
I'd eat your brains<br/>
